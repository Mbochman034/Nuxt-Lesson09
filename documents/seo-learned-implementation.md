// What I learned About SEO
The five years in the beginning of my career at a marketing agency gave me a bit of experience with SEO. However, as stated in the lesson content, this is constantly evolving and changing. Meta tags assignment to pages via the head script is something I've never used/seen before. I see the great value this could bring to not only SEO but accessibility/screen readers. Having the hierarchy of you page set up correctly via htags and semantic naming is something I will continue to pay close attention to when moving forward with development projects in the future. I think this could be tied in with my current projects at work as a UX/UI designer. User research that I conduct would go hand-in-hand with the discoverability of the site via meta tags.   

// Proposal/Implementation
I would love to go back into this site and do a more in-depth SEO implementation. Below would be my top-priorities when it comes to making the website more discoverable and valuable to the user.  

- Ensuring the use of the <header> tag on every page for webcrawler targeting 
- Proper use of hierarchical and semantic naming to increase traffic
- Social Media Integration: I would integrate social media integration
- Backlinking to external websites would be a great way to tie in additional resources for the user
- Implementing Google Analytics to better understand and adjust the website to meet the needs of the user
- Putting to use the Google Keyword Tool to research and discover keywords throughout the site for better SEO
